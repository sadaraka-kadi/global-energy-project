# Global Energy Project
An interactive Tableau data visualization project exploring global energy consumption patterns, renewable energy growth, and the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources across continents and countries from 1970 to 2025.

## Data Source
https://lowcarbonpower.org/

**Key Metrics**:
- Total Energy Consumption (TWh)
- Fossil Fuel Energy (TWh)
- Renewable Energy (TWh)
- Nuclear Energy (TWh)

**Geographic Coverage**: 
- 200+ countries
- 6 continents
- Regional and continental aggregations

**Temporal Coverage**: 1970-2025

## Methods
- Data cleaning & feature engineering in Python
- Energy dependency and transition metrics
- Interactive dashboards in Tableau Public
